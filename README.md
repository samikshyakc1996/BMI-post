Create a responsive web app which consumes an API and lists the data. In addition, create a form that will send data via a POST request.

Solution:

-A from has been created to capture User's details: Username, Password, Height and Weight.
-When the user creates submit, localhost:5000 port is initialized.

Node js and an express framework has been implemented to collect user details and fetch API using POST method.

Here are the Steps to run the web app: First Fork the Repository from the github link. And then:

1. NPM and Node should be installed. Check using command line:
   ~ node -v
   ~ npm -version
2. Use the command line: npm init
3. Install node_modules by using the command line:
   ~ npm install
4. Install express using the following command line:
   ~ npm install express.js
5. Run the server using:
   ~ node index
   If Successful, you should see a message "running" in your terminal.
6. Open index.html in your local machine.

Furthermore a RapidAPI has also been fetched to make the app meaningful. It uses the GET method, and calculates your BMI using your details of Height and Weight.
